        <p>It's <a href="http://krimson.be/en/stefaan-lippens-gets-free-ride-boston">official</a> now: I'm joining <a href="http://www.krimson.be">Krimson</a> on their trip to <a href="http://boston2008.drupalcon.org/">DrupalCon Boston 2008</a>! </p>
<p>Not more than a month ago, the nice people of Krimson <a href="http://krimson.be/en/krimson-invites-drupal-enthousiast-drupalcon-boston">offered</a> to fund the trip and stay at DrupalCon Boston for someone from the Belgian/European <a href="http://www.drupal.org">Drupal</a> community. At first I didn't really consider filling in the application form, because I thought some well known Drupal big shot would be selected. But after <a href="http://roosbisschop.be">my girlfriend</a> pushed me (thank you girlfriend), I decided to give it a try and filled in in <a href="http://krimson.be/node/56">the form</a>. When I received the mail of Krimson with the message that I was selected, I was completely flabbergasted. I'm sure this is only the beginning of an amazing experience and I'm really excited about it.</p>
<p>I guess I'm a bit off with my speculation that a well known Drupal big shot would get the plane ticket. So let me introduce myself a bit. Day job-wise I'm a PhD student at <a href="http://www.ugent.be">Ghent University</a>, doing research on halftoning and printing. (Indeed, that's the same university where <a href="http://drupal.org/user/1">Dries</a> <a href="http://buytaert.net/dr-dre">got his PhD</a> last month, but the funny thing is we didn't run into each other a lot even though we worked practically in the same building.)</p>
<p>I'm a Drupal user since 2005 (Drupal 4.5-ish) and I have a more than two year old Drupal account under the nickname <a href="http://drupal.org/user/41478">soxofaan</a>, but it was not before June 2007 I really began contributing. At that time I wanted to use the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/captcha">CAPTCHA module</a> on a site I was building, but I couldn't get the module to work properly. In the mean time I already bought and read the very interesting <a href="http://www.drupalbook.com/">Pro Drupal Development</a> book and my problem with the CAPTCHA module was an ideal real world use case for testing and sharpening my fresh Drupal coding skills. This personal hackfest resulted in an <a href="http://drupal.org/node/153395">almost completely rewrite</a> of the module, which was the basis of the 5.x-3.x branch, now works properly and has better usability (<a href="http://drupal.org/node/add/project-issue/captcha">I hope</a>). I also (re)wrote the image CAPTCHA module (included in the CAPTCHA module package as submodule), inspired by <a href="http://drupal.org/user/17943">Heine</a>'s <a href="http://heine.familiedeelstra.com/mycaptcha-download">MyCaptcha</a>. Not long after, I got CVS write permissions for the CAPTCHA module. Currently I'm active co-maintainer of CAPTCHA (together with <a href="http://drupal.org/user/61114">Rob Loach</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org/user/25523">wundo aka Fabiano Sant'Ana</a>) and try to follow up the bug reports an support requests as closely as my (free) time permits.</p>
<p>Beside the CAPTCHA module, which is roughly an API module, I also wrote the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/captcha_pack">CAPTCHA Pack module</a>, which is a collection of lightweight challenges. It includes for example challenges based on ASCII art, CSS-tricks and textual math representation. You've probably seen it in action already on <a href="http://groups.drupal.org">groups.drupal.org</a> for example.</p>
<p>In August 2007 I also took over maintainership of <a href="http://drupal.org/project/geshifilter">GeSHi Filter for syntax highlighting</a>, a Drupal flavored wrapper for the <a href="http://qbnz.com/highlighter/">GeSHi (Generic Syntax Highlighter) PHP library</a>, which supports syntax highlighting of over 80 programming languages. At that time, only a version for Drupal 4.7.x was available and maintenance was near-dead. After an initial port to Drupal 5, I also did a mayor overhaul (as the 5.x-2.x branch) with more features and better admin usability (and maintainability). See the user part in action on <a href="http://drupalbin.com">DrupalBin.com</a>.</p>
<p>As a last item of shameless self promotion I'd also like to mention the  <a href="http://drupal.org/project/search_engine_referers">Search Engine Referers</a> module (yes, I know "referers" should be spelled "referrers", but it's the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referer">web slang</a>). It's a very small and simple module for parsing the search engine referers  in your access log, so you know with what keywords visitors found your site.</p>
<p>All these modules have already a version for Drupal 6 in some form (from usable beta to 'stable' 6.x-1.0).</p>
<p>So, that's already too much as a first introduction probably. I'm very grateful to <a href="http://www.krimson.be">Krimson</a> for offering me this tremendous opportunity and I hope to live up to their expectations. </p>
<p>See you at Boston.</p>
